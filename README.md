# BanSwearInMovie
Basically, a little app to ban swearing in movies/tv shows. This is in alpha and will not be out for a long time.

#About
BanSwearInMovie is an app which takes the IMDb database and finds all titles. It then uses another package which takes every talking from that title and detects if it is swearing. If it is, the swear gets deleted.
